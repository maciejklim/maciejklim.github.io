![Maciej Klim](img/avatar.png "Maciej Klim")

I’m a cybersecurity professional working in MSP environments, supporting small and mid-sized organizations with a focus on practical defense, risk reduction, and operational stability. My experience aligns with Security Engineer and Tier 2–3 Analyst responsibilities, including vulnerability management, security operations, and automation across Microsoft-centric environments.

I have a strong interest in vulnerability management and have led sustained remediation efforts to meaningfully reduce organizational exposure. I enjoy building and improving processes that make security work more efficient and repeatable, whether through PowerShell automation, refining response workflows, or leading Windows 10 to Windows 11 upgrade initiatives to modernize and standardize endpoints.
